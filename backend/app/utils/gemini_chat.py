        "answer": "### Lease & Contract Termination Principles\n\n- **Notice Requirement:** Most jurisdictions and residential leases require written notice (typically **30 to 60 days**) prior to the expiration or intended move-out date.\n- **Early Termination Penalties:** Breaking a lease without statutory cause (such as military deployment, uninhabitable conditions, or domestic violence protections) usually incurs liquidated damages—commonly 1 to 2 months' rent plus forfeiture of security deposits.\n- **Mitigation of Damages:** In most US states, landlords have an affirmative legal duty to make reasonable efforts to re-rent the premises rather than simply charging the departing tenant for the entire remaining lease term.\n- **Action Tip:** Always send termination notices via Certified Mail with Return Receipt or tracked digital delivery as stipulated in the contract's Notice clause."
    },
    {
        "keywords": ["deposit", "security deposit", "refund", "withhold"],
        "answer": "### Security Deposit Protections & Timelines\n\n- **Statutory Return Windows:** State laws strictly mandate the return of security deposits (commonly **14 to 30 days** post-tenancy, e.g., 21 days in California, 30 days in Texas and New York).\n- **Itemized Deductions:** Landlords must provide an itemized statement detailing any deductions for damage beyond normal wear and tear, accompanied by receipts or cost estimates.\n- **Normal Wear and Tear:** Routine wall scuffs, faded paint, and carpet aging cannot legally be deducted from a tenant's deposit.\n- **Remedies for Bad Faith Withholding:** If a landlord wrongfully retains a deposit, many jurisdictions award the tenant up to **2x to 3x the deposit amount** in statutory punitive damages."

        "keywords": ["non-compete", "noncompete", "restrictive covenant", "competition"],
        "answer": "### Non-Compete Agreements & Enforceability\n\n- **Federal & State Trends:** The FTC and numerous states (California, Minnesota, North Dakota, Oklahoma) have enacted bans or severe limits on non-compete agreements for workers.\n- **Reasonableness Standards:** Where permitted, courts enforce non-competes only if narrowly tailored in three dimensions: **Duration** (typically 6–12 months maximum), **Geographic Scope** (limited to actual market territory), and **Scope of Activity** (only directly competing roles).\n- **Protectable Interest:** Employers must demonstrate a legitimate business interest—such as trade secrets or specialized goodwill—rather than merely suppressing labor mobility.\n- **Blue-Pencil Doctrine:** In some states, courts can modify overbroad restrictions, while other states strike down the entire agreement if any part is unreasonable."

    {
        "keywords": ["at-will", "at will", "probation", "fire", "termination of employment"],

    {
        "keywords": ["late fee", "grace period", "rent due", "payment"],
        "answer": "### Payment Due Dates & Late Fee Limits\n\n- **Grace Periods:** While rent is legally due on the date specified in the agreement (typically the 1st of the month), many state laws or contract terms mandate a **3 to 5-day grace period** before late penalties can be assessed.\n- **Reasonableness Caps:** Courts and statutes generally cap late fees at **5% to 8% of the monthly rent** (or a reasonable administrative cost). Unconscionable fees exceeding 10% are routinely struck down as unenforceable punitive damages.\n- **Notice of Default:** Before initiating formal summary ejectment or eviction proceedings, landlords must issue a statutory Notice to Pay or Quit (typically 3 to 10 days depending on the state)."
    },
    {
        "keywords": ["subrogation", "deductible", "loss", "insurance", "claim"],
        "answer": "### Insurance Policy Terms & Claim Rights\n\n- **Prompt Notice of Loss:** Insureds have a contractual duty to report damage or loss promptly. Failure to notify within the prescribed window (often 60 days) can provide grounds for denial if prejudice to the insurer is shown.\n- **Subrogation Clause:** Allows the insurance company to 'step into your shoes' to sue a responsible third party to recover claim payouts after indemnifying you.\n- **Replacement Cost vs. Actual Cash Value (ACV):** ACV deducts depreciation from the payout, whereas Replacement Cost covers the actual cost to repair or replace the item with new materials of like kind and quality."
    },
    {
        "keywords": ["governing law", "jurisdiction", "dispute", "arbitration"],
        "answer": "### Governing Law, Jurisdiction & Mandatory Arbitration\n\n- **Governing Law:** Establishes which state's substantive statutes and case law interpret the contract.\n- **Forum Selection:** Dictates the physical court or county where litigation must be filed.\n- **Mandatory Binding Arbitration:** Waives the right to a jury trial and class-action participation. While arbitration is often faster and private, it offers limited appeal rights and can be costly unless the drafting party covers administrative fees."
